# OnlineShoppingApp
Online Shopping Application (Command Line INterface) from my first Java Project. 

The functionality allowed users to:
- Display Inventory held in an Online Shop
- Rate products in the online shop
- Display Average Rating
- Exit program at any point in the application
- Command line interface 

I utilised Eclipse IDE to create this project.
